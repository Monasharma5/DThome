A grammar app can take a step much further. It can enable word search and pronunciation, sentence formation with tenses, grammar assessment questions with answers, with various difficulty levels. Such an app would help a student in learning the word meanings, understand the context of its use in sentences and the grammatical aspects aiding in rapid learning of a language. It can have options for multiple languages too.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning using Augmented Reality</strong></p>\n<p>Augmented Reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment that combines a view of the real world with computer-generated elements that can be through visual or audio means. Such an app is very effective when teachers require to present lessons or demonstrate experiments that require a 3-dimensional and natural perspective.
