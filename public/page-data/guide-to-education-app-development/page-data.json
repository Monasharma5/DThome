The next crucial thing would be to consider its features and functionalities. It will solve the purpose of users and will enhance their app experience.</p>\n<p>The features vary depending on the type of the app and problem you are looking to solve. But below features are genric and are implemented in every learning app:</p>\n<p><strong>1. User profile.</strong> Every user of your application must have his profile, where data on him, his completed topics and his success in learning will be stored.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Social networks integration.</strong> Users like to share their knowledge with their friends, colleagues and team. At times, they also need to share their certifications on business platforms like Linkedin for job hunting. So, social media integration let them do it. Apart from the share-oriented purpose, social media integration let users log in to their account easily.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Push Notifications.</strong> This is another mandatory feature of any mobile app. Push notifications keep the user updated about their progress, remind them of the uncompleted task and a new course upload. It increases the user engagement factor.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Feedback.</strong> Reviews at times are negative, but they are also a great way to improve your app in accordance with what users need from you. Reviews also help other customers decide whether they would opt for your services or not. So make sure you offer the best.</p>\n<p><strong>5. In-app Scheduling.</strong> The most effective feature of education app is scheduling time to take classes. This help students not to break the learning process and attend sessions even for half an hour. This help learners to build a habit and gradually make them improve. Furthermore, user take can track their progress.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Content Searches.</strong> The feature will help the user navigate within the application to easily find the information they are looking for without unnecessary efforts. And the quicker the user gets the ideal outcome, the better the odds that he'll keep using your learning application.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Analytics of learning progress.</strong> The feature provide an in-depth report of user started topics, learning progress and completed certifications. The Learning chart keeps them motivated to complete small education task.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Offline mode.</strong> A lot of apps does not offer this feature but it is important to provide content in offline mode.

Offline mode is most common in dictionaries but it must be included in all types of educational apps.</p>\n</div><div class=\"fusion-title title fusion-title-31 fusion-no-small-visibility fusion-no-medium-visibility fusion-sep-none fusion-title-text fusion-title-size-three\" style=\"--awb-text-color:#202020;--awb-font-size:35px;\"><h3 class=\"fusion-title-heading title-heading-left fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"font-family:&quot;Plus Jakarta Sans&quot;;font-style:normal;font-weight:300;margin:0;font-size:1em;letter-spacing:-0.015em;text-transform:capitalize;--fontSize:35;line-height:1.5;text-shadow:0px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Useful Tips On Education App Development</span></h3></div><div class=\"fusion-title title fusion-title-32 fusion-no-large-visibility fusion-sep-none fusion-title-text fusion-title-size-three\" style=\"--awb-text-color:#202020;--awb-font-size:25px;\"><h3 class=\"fusion-title-heading title-heading-left fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"font-family:&quot;Plus Jakarta Sans&quot;;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;margin:0;font-size:1em;letter-spacing:-0.015em;text-transform:capitalize;--fontSize:25;--minFontSize:25;line-height:1.5;text-shadow:0px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Useful Tips On Education App Development</span></h3></div><div class=\"fusion-text fusion-text-42\"><p>Merely developing an app will not guarantee your app success. There are aspects more to it.</p>\n<p>We'd like to give you some useful tips:</p>\n<p><strong>1. use real teaching methods.</strong> Offer rich content and imbibe engaging teaching methods like tutorials, quizzes in your app. Remember, the main purpose of your app is to provide education to your users. If it is not efficient, people will abandon your app.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Include game elements.</strong> Your app should find ways to make learning interesting. One way is to include gaming elements like Quizzes, Buzzer mode, Multiple choices. The gaming elements use a scoreboard that pushes users to learn better. Game elements are a must for elementary kids.</p>\n<p><strong>3. user-friendly interface.</strong> User Interface decides whether the user will stick to your app or uninstall it. The simple, nicer and clear the UI, the better the user stickiness. Great UI makes it easy for users to understand and use your app. And again, when it comes to children, the simplicity of design is supreme.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Compatibility with different devices.</strong> You don't know which platform or device your customer is using to access your app. So you must make your app compatible for all devices. If you don't have a development team who can make your app supportive to all devices, then hire an Education App Development team.</p>\n<p><strong>5. use bright graphics, widgets and interesting sounds.</strong> Include eye-catching illustrations and interesting sounds to make the user more and more use your app. Dull graphics turn down users and also make learning boring. While bright graphics are visually appealing and make the user stick to the app. At the same time, ensure that the sound effect can be turned off to meet the needs of all customers.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Offer Freemium plans.</strong> Freemium plans offer basic services for free and advance options for paid. This monetization method serves all customers who wish to only use free versions or paid versions.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Create your own Features.</strong> Following your competitor is good as long as it is only to be aware of the market trends. After that, you need to create a unique set of features to serve your audience. Your unique features give the audience a reason to switch to your product.</p>\n</div><div class=\"fusion-title title fusion-title-33 fusion-no-small-visibility fusion-no-medium-visibility fusion-sep-none fusion-title-text fusion-title-size-three\" style=\"--awb-text-color:#202020;--awb-font-size:35px;\"><h3 class=\"fusion-title-heading title-heading-left fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"font-family:&quot;Plus Jakarta Sans&quot;;font-style:normal;font-weight:300;margin:0;font-size:1em;letter-spacing:-0.015em;text-transform:capitalize;--fontSize:35;line-height:1.5;text-shadow:0px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost Of Developing An Education App</span></h3></div><div class=\"fusion-title title fusion-title-34 fusion-no-large-visibility fusion-sep-none fusion-title-text fusion-title-size-three\" style=\"--awb-text-color:#202020;--awb-font-size:25px;\"><h3 class=\"fusion-title-heading title-heading-left fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"font-family:&quot;Plus Jakarta Sans&quot;;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;margin:0;font-size:1em;letter-spacing:-0.015em;text-transform:capitalize;--fontSize:25;--minFontSize:25;line-height:1.5;text-shadow:0px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost Of Developing An Education App</span></h3></div><div class=\"fusion-text fusion-text-43\"><p>The cost of Education app development depends upon the time it takes to complete the development.
