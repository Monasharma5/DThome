There are several factors that influence global development. Economic and financial factors have a major influence with countries that have poor economic stability and excessive amounts of debt will have insufficient finance to self-sustain development. Environmental factors of regions with extreme climatic situations such as arid climates, cold climates, or natural disaster-prone areas not conducive for agriculture or comfortable life. Abundance or unavailability of natural resources determine the economic state of the countries. Social factors such as <strong>low education level</strong> and lack of essential resources such as food, water and shelter due to combination of the factors above have an impact on a region's development. We will examine the how education plays a significant role in global development.</p>\n</div><div class=\"fusion-title title fusion-title-1 fusion-no-small-visibility fusion-no-medium-visibility fusion-sep-none fusion-title-center fusion-title-text fusion-title-size-one\" style=\"--awb-text-color:#202020;--awb-font-size:35px;\"><h1 class=\"fusion-title-heading title-heading-center fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"font-family:&quot;Plus Jakarta Sans&quot;;font-style:normal;font-weight:300;margin:0;font-size:1em;letter-spacing:-0.015em;text-transform:capitalize;--fontSize:35;line-height:1.5;text-shadow:0px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Education in global development</span></h1></div><div class=\"fusion-title title fusion-title-2 fusion-no-large-visibility fusion-sep-none fusion-title-center fusion-title-text fusion-title-size-one\" style=\"--awb-text-color:#202020;--awb-font-size:25px;\"><h1 class=\"fusion-title-heading title-heading-center fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"font-family:&quot;Plus Jakarta Sans&quot;;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;margin:0;font-size:1em;letter-spacing:-0.015em;text-transform:capitalize;--fontSize:25;--minFontSize:25;line-height:1.5;text-shadow:0px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Education in global development</span></h1></div><div class=\"fusion-text fusion-text-3\"><p>Nelson Mandela's apt and famous quote, \"Education is the most powerful tool which you can use to change the world\" emphasizes the role of education in global development. Education is a powerful factor for sustained development across the globe that contributes to peace, health, and economic stability. Sustainable Development Goal 4 is one of the objectives of the United Nations about quality education which is to \"Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all\". It has been assessed by UNESCO that several millions of children and youth do not attend school, and this got further aggravated due to the Covid pandemic. Let us look at some important aspects of the role education in global development.</p>\n<p><strong>A robust education system:</strong> Education is required to be equitable across all sections of the society. This requires that a robust education system be constructed for the mass population of an environment ensuring Sustainable development. This is achieved as knowledge helps attain results that contribute to the wellbeing of the environment. Work opportunities are presented to educated individuals or groups, value of individuals' and society's health is realized, and wisdom to build a peaceful environment is instilled. Education therefore has equipped humans with the essential skills for economic and social sustenance that a robust education system can offer.</p>\n<p><strong>Primary and secondary education quality:</strong> Education at the foundation level helps inculcate values and responsibilities in individuals. Quality education during the elementary years is hence emphasized in several countries in nurturing wisdom and progressive knowledge acquisition.</p>\n<p><strong>Policies and framework:</strong> To achieve equitable education in mass of any country, there needs to be set of uniform policies driving reach out to all sections of the society. Formation of relevant curriculum with a meaningful pace of learning across the phases of education is being given attention. A framework that ensures measurement of results and delivery of teaching with the right policies in place will help build a strong education system.</p>\n<p><strong>Role of Digital Technology:</strong> In well-developed countries, digital technology has influenced the education system around the world in a unique manner to impart education, which is playing an effective role during the current pandemic. Educational app development enabled by advanced technologies is a new pattern of learning gaining momentum. Educational apps offer a highly interactive and fun-filled apps to trigger and sustain the interest of students in learning from elementary education through college.</p>\n<p>How has digital technology through educational app services positively influenced the education across world? As cited in a World Bank blog, the pandemic is worsening learning crisis especially for poor and vulnerable households that lack access to online resources in poor countries. In such countries, use of technology with devices such as smartphones has been a challenge and unexplored for imparting education, and hence a critical requirement for equity. Here are some ways that educational app services positively influence quality education across the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Remote Access:</strong> One of the foremost benefits is access to education irrespective of location. This can be achieved in multiple ways. Educational apps enable availability of teaching aids and requirements irrespective of time zones. Self-paced learning or Asynchronous learning is enabled through online courses that are available for the students to consume at their own pace without timelines. Instructor-led learning or Synchronous learning is enabled through virtual interactions with the instructor and other students in real time. Several apps are being developed that offer a variety of engaging approaches such as game-based learning, inquiry based and interactive regular digital classrooms. Remote learning is significant in global development since reachability to countries or regions is enhanced and quality of education can be progressively developed.</p>\n<p><strong>Wealth of knowledge:</strong> Learning app development services have facilitated children in accessing educational information in varied forms such as regular digital textbook content to multimedia-based services that are interactive and engaging. Education can be imparted in a Multilingual fashion enabling reach to countries where people do not understand commonly used international languages.</p>\n<p><strong>Tailored assistance:</strong> Educators can impart teaching with tailored subject content depending on the current state of education level in the environment or ability of the students. This enables a graded and steady imparting of knowledge. This sustains equity eventually.</p>\n<p><strong>Progressive assessment:</strong> Education app development services have enabled instructors to periodically assess academic performance of students through customizable digital report cards. Analytics can then be performed on the current level of education quality and progression in regions. This will enable global organizations to assess the quality of education and level of achievement in the mass population. This can be used for improvements in the education system as corrective procedures.</p>\n<p>For progress and subsequent sustenance of global development, technology and education play a key role to prepare the future generation with the right knowledge for local and global interaction, improving skillsets and enable healthy ecosystems across the world. Technology in education with the advent of mobile apps through smartphones have introduced an effective way of learning and improving the education system in the world irrespective of the geographical locations.</p>\n</div></div></div></div></div>\n","date":"2022-06-23T17:27:35","author":{"node":{"name":"Sanjay Kumar","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/12cd5109e81ca7f47c3bdfd017c1351234efe746c16d7811a74e031e6887c0e7?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}}},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","gatsbyImageData":null}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDo0Mjcz"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{"footer":"footer","header":"header"}}
