It is primarily aimed at relaxing the mind to enhance focus and awareness which helps one to gain control over the mind. In other words, meditation is to the mind as physical exercise is to the body.</p>\n<p>There are many types of meditation. Some examples are <strong>Mindfulness Meditation, Spiritual Meditation, Focused Meditation, Visualization Meditation, </strong>and<strong> Loving-Kindness meditation</strong>. Let us examine an overview of what some of these mean.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mindfulness Meditation:</strong> This is one of the easiest meditation techniques to practice wherein you need to focus on any object or your breath and lead yourself into a sense of calmness. This meditation technique combines concentration with breath control.</li>\n<li><strong>Focused Meditation:</strong> This technique involves focusing on a particular object such as beads or gongs or looking inwards towards an image of faith or a small light form.</li>\n<li><strong>Loving-Kindness Meditation:</strong> Loving-kindness meditation is used to strengthen feelings of compassion, kindness, and acceptance toward others. In the technique, the meditator imagines the exchange of feelings of kindness and love from their near and dear persons. This type of meditation is known to promote compassion and kindness. It helps people who hold feelings of anger or resentment by bringing out their kind and loving side of nature.</li>\n<li><strong>Visualization Meditation:</strong> This technique emphasizes visualizing positive experiences, images, or representative objects that trigger feelings of relaxation, peace, and calmness. The meditators can imagine themselves achieving specific goals thereby channeling their focus and increasing motivation. Visualization meditation is believed to boost an individual's mood, reduce stress levels, and promote inner peace.</li>\n<li><strong>Spiritual Meditation:</strong> This meditation technique is mostly practiced in temples to attain higher levels of spirituality.</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class=\"fusion-text fusion-text-19\"><p>Here are some of the ways that meditation can reshape your brain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhance gray matter density: Gray matter is the tissue that contains the majority of your brain's neurons. Studies have shown that meditation can increase the density of gray matter in areas of the brain that are involved in attention, memory, emotion regulation, and self-awareness.</li>\n<li>Decreases amygdala size: The amygdala is a part of the brain that is responsible for processing fear and other negative emotions. Studies have shown that meditation can reduce the size of the amygdala, making it less reactive to stress and negative stimuli.</li>\n<li>Strengthens prefrontal cortex connections: The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain that is responsible for decision-making, planning, and impulse control. Studies have shown that meditation can strengthen connections between the prefrontal cortex and other parts of the brain, improving cognitive function and executive functioning.</li>\n<li>Improves neuroplasticity: Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt over time. Meditation can improve neuroplasticity, making it easier for the brain to learn new things and recover from injury.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to its benefits for the brain, meditation has also been shown to have several other benefits for physical and mental health, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduced stress and anxiety</li>\n<li>Improved sleep quality</li>\n<li>Reduced pain</li>\n<li>Increased self-awareness</li>\n<li>Improved mood and emotional regulation</li>\n<li>Increased empathy and compassion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The development of meditation apps has offered an exceptional solution to peace and calm the mind, remove stress, and achieve mindfulness.

Reports of employees who meditated once a day at work using a <strong>meditation app</strong> reported significant improvements in their well-being, reduced job stress levels, and healthy workplace socialization. It trains your brain to respond in healthier ways to stressful situations making an individual respond to a situation and less reactive to it, thereby enabling quick recovery from a stressful or negative situation.</p>\n<p>Science says mental and physical stress increases cortisol levels (i.e., the \"stress hormone\"). Increased release of chemicals known as inflammatory cytokines has been linked to health issues such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. It has been assessed that mindful meditation decreases cytokine levels, reducing stress and anxiety.</p>\n<p>As per a paper from Nature's publication [Prevalence, patterns, and predictors of meditation use among US adults: A nationally representative survey], in medical diagnosis, research has shown that patients suffering from anxiety and depression attain benefits from incorporating mindfulness meditation. In one study, treatment plans incorporated meditation for patients suffering from chronic pain through controlled trials that proved beneficial to the patients. Another study involving patients receiving cancer treatment incorporated meditation which resulted in reduced anxiety, depression, and pain on post-intervention measures.</p>\n<p>The physiological benefit of meditation is attributed to improving active attention and self-regulation in the cortex region, stabilization of blood pressure, and decreasing cortisol levels. It has also been observed that meditation affects the parasympathetic nervous system which induces relaxation leading to physiological and biochemical changes.</p>\n</div><div class=\"fusion-text fusion-text-21\"><p>As per an article in the Harvard Gazette in Health and Medicine [When science meets mindfulness], researchers probing the effect of mindfulness meditation on patients suffering from depression observed using <strong>Magnetic Resonance Techniques (MRI)</strong> techniques that change brain activity in subjects who meditate hold steady even when they're not meditating thereby indicating stability.</p>\n<p>Meditation can help reverse brain patterns that lead to poor attention and mind-wandering thoughts, making it easier to tune out distractions thereby increasing focus. In one study, it was assessed that this helped participants increase the Gray Matter in key areas of their brains that are responsible for learning and memory processes, emotions, and increased attention spans.</p>\n<p>Meditation enhances lower reactivity to emotional and distressing scenarios, increases positive self-esteem, and higher coping abilities by decreasing negative emotions, unwanted rumination, and negative repressed feelings. In a study by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital in the USA, we have discovered that with regular practice of mindfulness meditation, the brain becomes thicker in the mid-prefrontal cortex and the mid-insular region of the brain.</p>\n<p>Meditation helps control one's cravings and addictions. Individuals who are addicted to elements such as alcohol or smoking, or basic cravings for unhealthy practices, can turn to meditation for de-addiction. Research has shown that people who practiced mindfulness meditation were much more likely to quit smoking than those who didn't. The human brain is known for its bio-plasticity and adaptive abilities. Meditation practices help create new neural networks in the brain that assist in self-control and detachment from addictions.</p>\n</div><div class=\"fusion-text fusion-text-22\"><p>If you are interested in trying meditation, there are many different resources available to help you get started.
